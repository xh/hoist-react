/**
 * A text input Component that generates a filter function based on simple word-boundary matching of
 * its value to the value of configured fields on a candidate object. If any field values match, the
 * object itself is considered a match.
 *
 * This component is designed to be bound to a Store via either its `store` OR `gridModel` props.
 * (If not configured to bind to a specific Store or GridModel, this component will bind by default
 * to the store of the nearest GridModel found in context.) Binding in this way allows the component
 * to auto-generate the fields in the store to be included in the filter and to automatically
 * apply the filter to the Store.
 *
 * In cases where the application is combining this filter with other filters, or applying
 * additional application logic, the filter can be managed manually by setting `autoApply` to
 * `false` and using the `onFilterChange` callback instead.
 *
 * Fields to be searched can be automatically determined from the bound Store or GridModel, and/or
 * customized via the include/excludeFields props. See prop comments for details.
 *
 * This component supports all props available to TextInput and will pass them along to its
 * underlying TextInput.
