 * Model for a data field within a Form. Specifies the field's name, user-facing label, validation
 * rules, and other properties. Holds the field's value as initialized by a parent FormModel or
 * updated by a user interacting with a bound FormField component.
 *
 * These models are typically created by passing configuration objects to the constructor of FormModel.
 * The parent Form/FormModel and the FormField component work together to bind to this model by name.
