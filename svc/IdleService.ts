/**
 * Manage the idling/suspension of this application after a certain period of user inactivity
 * to cancel background tasks and prompt the user to reload the page when they wish to resume
 * using the app. This approach is typically employed to reduce potential load on back-end
 * system from unattended clients and/or as a "belt-and-suspenders" defence against memory
 * leaks or other performance issues that can arise with long-running sessions.
 *
 * This service consults the `xhIdleConfig` soft-config and the `xhIdleDetectionDisabled`
 * user preference to determine if and when it should suspend the app.
