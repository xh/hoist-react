/**
 * Service to read soft-configuration values.
 *
 * Server-side configuration support is provided by hoist-core. AppConfigs must be predefined on the
 * server (they can be managed by the Admin console) and are referenced by their string key. These
 * entries can then be changed on the fly or given per-environment values that allow the app to
 * adjust without requiring a code change or redeployment.
 *
 * Note that for a config to be available here on the client, it must have its `clientVisible` flag
 * set to true. This is to provide support for configurations that should *not* be sent down for
 * possible inspection by end users.
 *
 * Note that this service does *not* currently attempt to reload or update configs once the client
 * application has loaded. A refresh of the application is required to load new entries.
