/**
 * Core superclass for stateful Models in Hoist. Models are used throughout the toolkit and
 * applications as backing stores for components and as general all-purpose constructs for
 * loading, storing, processing, and observing business data and other application state.
 *
 * The most common use of `HoistModel` is to support Hoist components. Components can be configured
 * to create or lookup an instance of an appropriate model subclass using the `model` config passed
 * to {@link hoistComponent.factory}. Hoist will automatically pass the resolved model instance as a
 * prop to the component's `render()` function, where the model's properties can be read/rendered
 * and any imperative APIs wired to buttons, callbacks, and other handlers.
 *
 * Certain models are instantiated by Hoist and linked directly in a one-to-one relationship with
 * a specific component that renders them. These models are considered "linked", and they play a
 * special role in the framework.  In particular, linked models:
 *      - are specified by the {@link creates} directive as well as the {@link useLocalModel} hook.
 *      - support an observable {@link componentProps} property which can be used to observe the
 *      props of their associated component.
 *      - support a {@link lookupModel} method and a `@lookup` decorator that can be used to acquire
 *      references to "ancestors" to this model in the component hierarchy.
 *      - support {@link onLinked} and {@link afterLinked} lifecycle methods, called during the
 *      first rendering of their associated component. Use these methods for any work requiring the
 *      availability of lookups or `componentProps`.
 *      - have `loadAsync()` called automatically when their component is first mounted, as well
 *      as register themselves for subsequent refreshes with the nearest {@link RefreshContextModel}
 *      in the component hierarchy.
 *      - are destroyed when their linked component is unmounted.
 *
 * It is very common to decorate properties on models with `@observable` and related field-level
 * annotations. This enables automatic, MobX-powered re-rendering of components when these model
 * properties change, or when specific reactions have been wired by the developer via
 * `addReaction()` and related utils from {@link HoistBase}.
 *
 * When declaring any observable properties on your model class, note that you **must** call
 * `makeObservable(this)` within your model's constructor in order for MobX to begin tracking your
 * observables and reacting to changes.
 *
 * HoistModels that need to load or refresh their state from any external source (e.g. a remote
 * API or local service call) are encouraged to implement the abstract `doLoadAsync()` method
 * defined on this superclass. This will trigger the installation of a {@link LoadSupport} instance
 * on the model and enable several extensions to help track and manage async loads via the model's
 * public `loadAsync()` entry point.
