 * Top-level refresh context model - triggers a full refresh of the app via a call to `loadAsync()`
 * on the AppModel, followed by refreshes of any target models within the component hierarchy.
 *
 * An instance of this object is installed and linked by the framework as `XH.refreshContextModel`
 * and should *not* be created or managed by application code.
 *
 * The `XH.refreshAppAsync()` convenience method is the recommended entry-point for apps to call.
