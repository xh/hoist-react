 *  full Hoist initialization. This means that several core services (identity, configs, prefs)
 *  will *not* be available, but it provides the app a hook to
 *  do early service initialization or other work to support flows such as OAuth.
 *
 *  The base implementation of this class is minimal and would be adequate only for fully
 *  transparent SSO based solutions such as NTLM.  Applications wishing to provide custom
 *  authentication should provide an extended version of this class to `XH.renderApp`

     *
     * It should return true if the user could be successfully authenticated, false if the user
     * is not authenticated, and throw in the case of technical failure. If false is returned and
     * `AppSpec.enableLoginForm` is true the framework will enter the 'loginRequired' state and
     * show the user a *manual* login form.
     *
     *  The default implementation of this method simply checks the auth status on the server, which
     *  may be appropriate for fully SSO (e.g. NTLM) based solutions.  Override to consult or
     *  initialize third-party client resources such as OAuth.
