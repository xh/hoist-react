 *  Base class for managing authentication lifecycle.

 *  Hoist will consult this model early in  the initialization sequence, prior to full Hoist
 *  initialization. This means that several core services (identity, configs, prefs) will *not* be
 *  available, but it provides the app a hook to do early service initialization or other work to
 *  support flows such as OAuth.
 *
 *  The base implementation of this class is minimal and would be adequate only for fully
 *  transparent SSO based solutions such as NTLM.  Applications wishing to provide custom
 *  authentication should spec an extended version of this class in the {@link AppSpec} passed to
 *  {@link XHApi#renderApp}.

     * It should return true if the user could be successfully authenticated, false if the user
     * is not authenticated, and throw in the case of technical failure. If false is returned and
     * `AppSpec.enableLoginForm` is true the framework will enter the 'LOGIN_REQUIRED' state and
     * show the user a form-based login with username and password fields to be submitted securely
     * to the server.
     *
     * The default implementation of this method simply checks the auth status on the server, which
     * may be appropriate for fully SSO (e.g. NTLM) based solutions. Override to consult or
     * initialize third-party client resources such as OAuth.
