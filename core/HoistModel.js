/**
 * Core superclass for stateful Models in Hoist. Models are used throughout the toolkit and
 * applications as backing stores for components and as general all-purpose constructs for
 * loading, storing, processing, and observing business data and other application state.
 *
 * The most common use of `HoistModel` is to support Hoist components. Components can be configured
 * to create or lookup an instance of an appropriate model subclass using the `model` config passed
 * to {@see hoistComponent} factory. Hoist will automatically pass the resolved model instance as a
 * prop to the component's `render()` function, where the model's properties can be read/rendered
 * and any imperative APIs wired to buttons, callbacks, and other handlers.
 *
 * Models in Hoist store the rendered state of the app and are closely associated with the React
 * Component tree.  In fact, most models are linked directly in a one-to-one relationship with a
 * specific component that renders them -- these models are considered "linked", and play a
 * special role in the framework.  In particular, linked models:
 *      - are specified by the `creates` and `hosts` directives to hoist component, as well as the
 *      `useLocalModel` hook.
 *      - support an observable `componentProps` property which can be used to observe the props of
 *      their rendered component.
 *      - support a `lookupModel` method and `@lookup` decorator that can be used to acquire references
 *      to "ancestors" to this model in the component hierarchy.
 *      - support an `onLinked` lifecycle method, called when the model has been fully linked to
 *      the component hierarchy. Use this method for any work requiring the availability of lookups
 *      or `componentProps`.  Note that this method is called during the initial rendering
 *      of the component creating this model.
 *
 * It is very common to decorate properties on models with `@observable` and related field-level
 * annotations. This enables automatic, MobX-powered re-rendering of components when these model
 * properties change, or when specific reactions have been wired by the developer via
 * `addReaction()` and related utils from {@see HoistBase}.  When declaring any observable
 * properties on your model class, note that you **must** call `makeObservable(this)` to initialize
 * the observability of the object.
 *
 * HoistModels that need to load or refresh their state from any external source (e.g. a remote
 * API or local service call) are encouraged to implement the abstract `doLoadAsync()` method
 * defined on this superclass. This will trigger the installation of a {@see LoadSupport} instance
 * on the model and enable several extensions to help track and manage async loads via the model's
 * public `loadAsync()` entry point.
 *
 * If the model is owned by a component, its `loadAsync()` be called automatically when the
 * component is first mounted and whenever triggered by the nearest {@see RefreshContextModel}
 * in the component hierarchy.
