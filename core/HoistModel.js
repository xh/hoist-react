/**
 * Core superclass for stateful Models in Hoist. Models are used throughout the toolkit and
 * applications as backing stores for components and as general all-purpose constructs for
 * loading, storing, processing, and observing business data and other application state.
 *
 * The most common use of `HoistModel` is to support Hoist components. Components can be configured
 * to create or lookup an instance of an appropriate model subclass using the `model` config passed
 * to {@see hoistComponent} factory. Hoist will automatically pass the resolved model instance as a
 * prop to the component's `render()` function, where the model's properties can be read/rendered
 * and any imperative APIs wired to buttons, callbacks, and other handlers.
 *
 * Models in Hoist are created in a tree-like hierarchy that is closely associated with the React
 * Component Tree.  The following mechanisms support this important relationship:
 *      - The `componentProps` observable property.  This property will be populated for models
 *      directly associated with an "owning" component (i.e. the model was created via
 *      the `creates()` directive in HoistComponent, or the `useLocalModel()` hook.)
 *      - The @parent decorator. Use this to inject references to other HoistModels which are
 *      "ancestors" to this model in the component hierarchy.
 *      - The @managed decorator.  Use this to indicated  submodels that should be linked to
 *      the component hierarchy together with this model. These models can therefore perform lookups
 *      and will be available for (limited) lookup by other components and models in the hierarchy.
 *      - The onLinked() lifecyle method.  This method will be called when this model (or the model
 *      managing it) has been fully linked to the component hierarchy. Use this method for any work
 *      requiring the availability of parent models or `componentProps`.  Note that this method is
 *      called during the initial rendering of the component creating this model.
 *
 * It is very common to decorate properties on models with `@observable` and related field-level
 * annotations. This enables automatic, MobX-powered re-rendering of components when these model
 * properties change, or when specific reactions have been wired by the developer via
 * `addReaction()` and related utils from {@see HoistBase}.  When declaring any observable
 * properties on your model class, note that you **must** call `makeObservable(this)` to initialize
 * the observability of the object.
 *
 * HoistModels that need to load or refresh their state from any external source (e.g. a remote
 * API or local service call) are encouraged to implement the abstract `doLoadAsync()` method
 * defined on this superclass. This will trigger the installation of a {@see LoadSupport} instance
 * on the model and enable several extensions to help track and manage async loads via the model's
 * public `loadAsync()` entry point.
 *
 * If the model is owned by a component, its `loadAsync()` be called automatically when the
 * component is first mounted and whenever triggered by the nearest {@see RefreshContextModel}
 * in the component hierarchy.
