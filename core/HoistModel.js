/**
 * Core superclass for stateful Models in Hoist. Models are used throughout the toolkit and
 * applications as backing stores for components and as general all-purpose constructs for
 * loading, storing, processing, and observing business data and other application state.
 *
 * The most common use of `HoistModel` is to support Hoist components. Components can be configured
 * to create or lookup an instance of an appropriate model subclass using the `model` config passed
 * to {@see hoistComponent} factory. Hoist will automatically pass the resolved model instance as a
 * prop to the component's `render()` function, where the model's properties can be read/rendered
 * and any imperative APIs wired to buttons, callbacks, and other handlers.
 *
 * Certain models are instantiated by Hoist and linked directly in a one-to-one relationship with
 * a specific component that renders them -- these models are considered "linked", and play a
 * special role in the framework.  In particular, linked models:
 *      - are specified by the `creates` directive as well as the `useLocalModel` hook.
 *      - support an observable `componentProps` property which can be used to observe the props of
 *      their associated component.
 *      - support a `lookupModel` method and a `@lookup` decorator that can be used to acquire
 *      references to "ancestors" to this model in the component hierarchy.
 *      - support `onLinked` and `afterLinked` lifecycle methods, called during the first rendering
 *      of their associated component.  Use these methods for any work requiring the availability
 *      of lookups or `componentProps`.
 *      - have `loadAsync()` called automatically when their component is first mounted, as well
 *      as register themselves for subsequent refreshes with the nearest {@see RefreshContextModel}
 *      in the component hierarchy.
 *      - are destroyed when their linked component is unmounted.
 *
 * It is very common to decorate properties on models with `@observable` and related field-level
 * annotations. This enables automatic, MobX-powered re-rendering of components when these model
 * properties change, or when specific reactions have been wired by the developer via
 * `addReaction()` and related utils from {@see HoistBase}.  When declaring any observable
 * properties on your model class, note that you **must** call `makeObservable(this)` to initialize
 * the observability of the object.
 *
 * HoistModels that need to load or refresh their state from any external source (e.g. a remote
 * API or local service call) are encouraged to implement the abstract `doLoadAsync()` method
 * defined on this superclass. This will trigger the installation of a {@see LoadSupport} instance
 * on the model and enable several extensions to help track and manage async loads via the model's
 * public `loadAsync()` entry point.
