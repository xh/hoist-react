/**
 * Core superclass for stateful Models in Hoist. Models are used throughout the toolkit and
 * applications as backing stores for components and as general all-purpose constructs for
 * loading, storing, processing, and observing business data and other application state.
 *
 * The most common use of `HoistModel` is to support Hoist components. Components can be configured
 * to create or lookup an instance of an appropriate model subclass using the `model` config passed
 * to {@see hoistComponent} factory. Hoist will automatically pass the resolved model instance as a
 * prop to the component's `render()` function, where the model's properties can be read/rendered
 * and any imperative APIs wired to buttons, callbacks, and other handlers.
 *
 * It is very common to decorate properties on models with `@observable` and related field-level
 * annotations. This enables automatic, MobX-powered re-rendering of components when these model
 * properties change, or when specific reactions have been wired by the developer via
 * `addReaction()` and related utils from {@see HoistBase}.
 *
 * When declaring any observable properties on your model class, note that you **must** define a
 * constructor for it and call `makeObservable(this)` from within that constructor.
 *
 * When model is *created* by a HoistComponent it is considered to be 'owned' by that component,
 * meaning its existence is directly tied to the lifecycle of the component. An owned model will be
 * automatically destroyed when its component is unmounted.
 *
 * HoistModels that need to load or refresh their state from any external source (e.g. a remote
 * API or local service call) are encouraged to implement the abstract `doLoadAsync()` method
 * defined on this superclass. This will trigger the installation of a {@see LoadSupport} instance
 * on the model and enable several extensions to help track and manage async loads via the model's
 * public `loadAsync()` entry point.
 *
 * If the model is owned by a component, its `loadAsync()` be called automatically when the
 * component is first mounted and whenever triggered by the nearest {@see RefreshContextModel}
 * in the component hierarchy.
