/**
 * Specialized base class for defining the central model for a Hoist app as specified by its
 * {@see AppSpec.modelClass} config. That config should reference a concrete implementation class
 * extending this base. Hoist will create and then initialize an instance of that class after
 * the framework has successfully initialized and will make it available to all app code via the
 * `XH.appModel` getter.
 *
 * Applications should specify this class to provide application level state and services and
 * customize important metadata. Initialization of all resources (e.g. application level services)
 * should be done in `initAsync()`.
 *
 * Hoist will load/reload this Model during the global refresh process.  This will occur before the
 * application's global XH.refreshContextModel has been refreshed, (when all mounted and 'owned'
 * HoistModels in the application are refreshed). AppModels should implement `doLoadAsync()` if
 * required to refresh all other app-wide services and models, respecting any ordering and phasing
 * requirements specific to its needs. {@see HoistModel.doLoadAsync()}
