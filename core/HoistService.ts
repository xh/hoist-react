/**
 * Core superclass for Services in Hoist. Services are special classes used in both Hoist and
 * application code as centralized points for managing app-wide state and loading / processing
 * data from external APIs.
 *
 * Services are distinct from Models in that they are typically constructed and initialized within
 * either `XH` (for Hoist-provided services) or within the `initAsync()` method of your primary
 * `AppModel` - {@see XH.installServicesAsync()}. A single instance of each service is constructed
 * and installed as a property on the `XH` singleton.
 *
 * (E.g. an app that defines and initializes a custom `TradeEntryService` class can access and use
 * that instance as `XH.tradeEntryService`. This mirrors the pattern for singleton service
 * injection used within the Grails server.)
 *
 * Services are most commonly used as engines within an application for loading, processing, and
 * potentially caching data, although keep in mind their singleton nature when maintaining and
 * updating state within your service. (E.g. if your service caches business objects and hands them
 * out to callers, take care that those shared objects aren't modified by callers in unexpectedly
 * shared ways.)
 *
 * Services extend `HoistBase` and can therefore leverage MobX-powered observables and reactions if
 * so desired. And while components should typically source their state from backing models, they
 * can also read and react to service state and call service APIs.
