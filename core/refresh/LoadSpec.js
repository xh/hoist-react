/**
 * Metadata describing a load/refresh request in Hoist.
 *
 * Instances of this class are created within the public API wrappers provided by the `LoadSupport`
 * base class and are passed to subclass (i.e. application code) implementations of `doLoadAsync()`.
 *
 * Application implementations of `doLoadAsync()` can consult this object's flags. Of particular
 * interest are the `isStale` and `isObsolete` properties, which implementations can read after any
 * async calls return to determine if a newer, subsequent load has already been requested:
 *
 *   + `isStale` will be true if any loads have been *started* after the run being evaluated.
 *   + `isObsolete` will return true if there is a newer load which has successfully *completed*.
 *
 * In addition, `doLoadAsync()` implementations should typically pass along this object to any
 * calls they make to `loadAsync()` on other objects, as well as all calls to `FetchService` APIs.
 *
 * Note that Hoist's exception handling and activity tracking will consult the `isAutoRefresh` flag
 * on specs associated with their calls to automatically adjust their behavior (e.g. not showing an
 * exception dialog on error, not tracking background refresh activity).
 *
 * {@see LoadSupport}
