 * Specialized base class for defining the central model for a Hoist app as specified by its
 * See the {@link AppSpec.modelClass} config, which should reference a concrete implementation class
 * extending this base. Hoist will create and then initialize an instance of that class after
 * the framework has successfully initialized and will make it available to all app code via the
 * `XH.appModel` getter.
 *
 * Applications should specify this class to provide application level state and services and
 * customize important metadata. Initialization of all resources (e.g. application level services)
 * should be done in `initAsync()`.
 *
 * Hoist will load/reload this Model during the global refresh process. This will occur before the
 * application's global `XH.refreshContextModel` has been refreshed (when all mounted and 'owned'
 * HoistModels in the application are refreshed). AppModels should implement `doLoadAsync()` if
 * required to refresh all other app-wide services and models, respecting any ordering and phasing
 * requirements specific to its needs.
