/**
 * Object describing a load/refresh request in Hoist.
 *
 * Instances of this class are created within the public APIs provided by {@link LoadSupport}
 * and are passed to subclass (i.e. app-level) implementations of `doLoadAsync()`.
 *
 * Application implementations of `doLoadAsync()` can consult this object's flags. Of particular
 * interest are {@link isStale} and {@link isObsolete}, which implementations can read after any
 * async calls return to determine if a newer, subsequent load has already been requested.
 *
 * In addition, `doLoadAsync()` implementations should typically pass along this object to any
 * calls they make to `loadAsync()` on other objects + all calls to {@link FetchService} APIs.
 *
 * Note that Hoist's exception handling and activity tracking will consult the {@link isAutoRefresh}
 * flag on specs passed to their calls to automatically adjust their behavior (e.g. not showing an
 * exception dialog on error, not tracking background refresh activity).
 *
 * @see LoadSupport
