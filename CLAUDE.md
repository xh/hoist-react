## Consult the Documentation

**Before modifying or extending hoist-react code, consult the documentation index at
[`/docs/README.md`](./docs/README.md).** It catalogs all package READMEs and cross-cutting concept
docs with descriptions and key topic keywords. Use the "Quick Reference by Task" table to find the
right doc for your goal, then read the relevant README(s) to understand existing architecture,
configuration patterns, and common pitfalls. These docs are the authoritative reference for how
Hoist packages work and how they are intended to be used — skipping them risks producing code
that conflicts with established patterns or misses built-in functionality.
