# Build-related files

Hoist Dev Utils (`@xh/hoist-dev-utils`, aka HDU) references the files in this directory from
within its `configureWebpack()` build script factory.

* `index.html` - passed to `WebpackHTMLPlugin` by HDU <= v5.3.0, which uses it to build the HTML
  index files for each JS app entry point created by the webpack build. This is the original
  variation of this index file and inlines a small Hoist preflight routine via a `<script>` tag.
* `index-no-inline.html` - passed to `WebpackHTMLPlugin` by HDU >= v5.4.0. This variation does not
  inline any scripts, allowing us to block inline JS via Content Security Policy (CSP) headers as a
  security best practice.
* `polyfills.js` - passed to webpack in the `entry` config for each JS app entry point, ensuring
  that it imports the two global polyfills (`core-js` and `regenerator-runtime`) once per app. It is
  hosted here to ensure that the version of these libraries specified as a dependency by hoist-react
  are the ones used / imported for the app. The app should not need to specify its own dependency on
  either library.
* `preflight.js` - included by later HDU versions (see above) before any other Hoist or application
  code runs on the page. Used to start page load timing and run a low-level filter for browser
  compatibility.
* `requiredBlueprintIcons.js` - included by HDU >= v5.2 as a (very) streamlined replacement for the
  full set of Blueprint JS icons otherwise required by that library. See the comment at the top of
  the file for additional details and links.
* `spinner.png` - included by HDU >= 5.11 and embedded within static `index-no-inline.html` entry
  page to provide visual indicator that something is happening when JS app has yet to d/l and start.
